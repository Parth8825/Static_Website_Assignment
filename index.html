                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operating system (OS) is the software component for the computer system that is responsible to run the components with the hardware which are attached with the computer and, also for the management and sharing the resources between computers. The OS acts as a host for all the applications that are running in the machine without that nothing is important. As a host, one of the purposes of an OS is to handle the details of the operation of the hardware. This relieves application programs from having to manage these details and makes it easier to write applications. Almost all computers use an OS of some type.</p>
